        <p class="goals1">
            I ventured into tech this year with Zuri and I can say it has being quite a journey. I have learnt a whole
            lot, still in the process of learning. I remember my first tutorial class, how enthusiastic I was. Even when
            I built my first responsive calculator, I was so ecstatic. Now, I‚Äôm here at HNG11. I was a bit skeptical
            about enrolling but decided to push myself. I‚Äôve heard tales of how challenging and nerve racking HNG can be
            but I‚Äôm willing to challenge myself. I mean, I have nothing to lose rightü§∑üèΩ‚ÄçÔ∏è. So my goals are pretty
            simple, it has already begun since I‚Äôm here.
        </p>
        <p class="goals2">
            My immediate goal is to challenge myself and make sure that I become a finalist. My professional goal in the
            next 2years is to scale up and be so much better than I am now, expand my knowledge, add other languages to
            my skillset. I want to build and ship products that makes an impact and is going to be used by thousands
            across the globe. I want to have polished and refined my skills to a point where mediocrity isn‚Äôt attached
            to me. I want to make good friends in the industry, build connections. Showing up everyday, giving my 1%
            each day will enable me get there and I‚Äôve just begun.
